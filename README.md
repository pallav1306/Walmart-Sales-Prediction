# Walmart-Sales-Prediction
A predictive model using linear regression to find out the sales of each product at a given walmart store

This data science project in python is to predict the sales for each department using past data from the Walmart dataset containing data of 45 Walmart stores. This project features a exploratory analysis and my predictive model was primarily based on linear regression

This project shows the impact of holiday markdown events on various departments in the store as well as its extent.

In order to predict the weekly sales also, a linear regression model is used to find a specific value. Perform dimensionality reduction in order to reduce overfitting and improve the resulting error.
